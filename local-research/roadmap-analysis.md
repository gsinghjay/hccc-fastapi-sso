Based on the `README.md` and the current codebase, the next item on our roadmap that needs to be implemented is **Database Setup (SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL)**, specifically focusing on `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py`.

Here's a breakdown of what's already implemented and what's next for this roadmap item:

**What's Already Implemented (Based on Codebase):**

*   **Basic Database Connection Infrastructure:**
    *   The files `app/db/base.py` and `app/db/session.py` exist, indicating that the initial structure for database interaction is in place.
    *   `app/db/base.py` defines `get_db` function, which is a dependency injection provider for database sessions using `AsyncSessionLocal`.
    *   `app/db/session.py` sets up `create_async_engine` and `AsyncSessionLocal` using configurations from `app/core/config.py`.
    *   The `conftest.py` file contains fixtures like `client` and `test_settings` which suggest the testing environment is configured to some extent, possibly including database overrides for testing.

**What's Next - Database Setup (SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL):**

According to the Roadmap in `README.md` (steps 3 and the code block examples):

1.  **Implement `app/db/session.py` to establish a SQLAlchemy engine and session.**
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented.  The files exist and contain code for engine and session creation, but the roadmap explicitly mentions implementing `app/db/session.py` using `asyncpg` for asynchronous database interaction and creating separate settings for production and testing databases. We need to ensure these aspects are fully addressed and tested.
    *   **Action:** Review and potentially enhance `app/db/session.py` to strictly adhere to asynchronous interaction with `asyncpg` and verify the separation of production and testing database configurations as described in the roadmap.

2.  **Implement `app/db/base.py` to define a base class for SQLAlchemy models.**
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented. `app/db/base.py` exists and defines `Base = declarative_base()`, which serves as a base class for SQLAlchemy models.
    *   **Action:** Review and confirm if `app/db/base.py` is complete as intended. The roadmap mentions testing this file to ensure it provides a base class for declarative models. We need to write tests for this if not already done.

3.  **Testing Database Setup:**
    *   **Status:** Tests are likely not fully implemented yet for `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py` specifically, although `conftest.py` suggests some testing infrastructure is in place.
    *   **Action:** Write tests for `app/db/session.py` to ensure it correctly creates a database engine and session using the configured database URL. Test both production and testing database configurations as highlighted in the roadmap.  Write tests for `app/db/base.py` to confirm it provides the base class as expected.

**In summary, the immediate next step is to complete the "Database Setup (SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL)" roadmap item by:**

*   **Reviewing and enhancing `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py` to align with the roadmap details.**
*   **Writing comprehensive tests for `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py` as outlined in the roadmap to ensure correct database connection and base model setup.**

After fully completing and testing the Database Setup, the next item on the roadmap will be **User Model (SQLAlchemy)**, which is currently not started as `app/models/user.py` file is missing.
