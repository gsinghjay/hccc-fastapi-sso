## Implementation Plan: Database Setup (SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL)

**Goal:** Implement `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py` to establish a functional database connection using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL, suitable for both production and testing environments.

**Production-First Approach:** This plan prioritizes setting up a robust and production-ready database layer from the outset. This includes considering configuration, asynchronous operations, connection management, and testability with production best practices in mind.

**Step 1: Test Implementation for `app/db/session.py`**

Create a new test file: `tests/db/test_session.py`

**Test Cases:**

1.  **Test: Successful Asynchronous Engine Creation (Production Config)**
    *   **Description:** Verify that `app/db/session.py` correctly creates an asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine when using production-like settings from `app/core/config.py`.
    *   **Test Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncEngine
        from app.db.session import engine as production_engine
        from app.core.config import get_settings

        def test_production_engine_creation() -> None:
            """Test successful engine creation with production settings."""
            settings = get_settings() # Assuming default settings are production-like
            assert isinstance(production_engine, AsyncEngine)
            assert str(production_engine.url) == str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI)
        ```

2.  **Test: Successful Asynchronous Engine Creation (Testing Config Override)**
    *   **Description:** Verify engine creation with settings overridden for testing (e.g., using in-memory SQLite for faster tests in future, or a dedicated test PostgreSQL database). For now, we'll test against test database details from `conftest.py`.
    *   **Test Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncEngine
        from app.db.session import engine as test_engine # May need to conditionally create test engine
        from tests.conftest import get_settings_override

        def test_test_engine_creation() -> None:
            """Test successful engine creation with test settings override."""
            test_settings = get_settings_override()
            # Assuming we might have a separate engine for tests, or reuse production_engine with override
            # Adjust assertion based on actual implementation in app/db/session.py
            assert isinstance(test_engine, AsyncEngine) # Adjust if 'test_engine' is not directly exposed
            # Verify the engine URL matches the test database configuration
            # This might require adjusting how engine is accessed if not directly exposed.
            # For now, assuming we can access it or modify session.py to expose a test engine.
            assert str(test_engine.url) == str(test_settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI)
        ```

3.  **Test: `get_db` Dependency Yields Asynchronous Session**
    *   **Description:** Test that the `get_db` dependency function correctly yields an `AsyncSession` and closes it after use.
    *   **Test Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        import pytest
        from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
        from app.db.session import get_db

        async def test_get_db_yields_async_session() -> None:
            """Test get_db dependency yields and closes AsyncSession."""
            async def test_dependency():
                async for session in get_db():
                    assert isinstance(session, AsyncSession)
                    yield session # Yield for further checks if needed

            async for session_gen in test_dependency():
                session = session_gen
                assert session.is_active # Session should be active when yielded

            # Session should be closed after exiting the async context manager
            assert not session.is_active # Session should be closed after use
        ```

**Step 2: Implement `app/db/session.py`**

```python
"""
Database session management using SQLAlchemy.
"""
from typing import AsyncGenerator
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession, async_sessionmaker
from app.core.config import get_settings

settings = get_settings()

# Create asynchronous engine for the database
engine = create_async_engine(
    str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI),
    echo=settings.DEBUG, # Echo SQL statements if debug is enabled
    pool_pre_ping=True, # Test database connections before use
)

# Create asynchronous session factory
AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
    bind=engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False, # Avoids issues with detached instances after commit
    autoflush=False, # Autoflush can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in async contexts
)

async def get_db() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    """
    Asynchronous dependency to get a database session.

    Yields:
        AsyncSession: Database session.
    """
    session = AsyncSessionLocal()
    try:
        yield session
    finally:
        await session.close()
```

**Step 3: Run Tests for `app/db/session.py`**

Run pytest specifically for `tests/db/test_session.py`:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/db/test_session.py
```

Debug and adjust `app/db/session.py` and tests until all tests pass.

**Step 4: Test Implementation for `app/db/base.py`**

Create a new test file: `tests/db/test_base.py`

**Test Cases:**

1.  **Test: `Base` is an instance of `DeclarativeBase`**
    *   **Description:** Verify that `Base` from `app/db.base` is correctly created using `declarative_base`.
    *   **Test Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase
        from app.db.base import Base

        def test_base_is_declarative_base() -> None:
            """Test that Base is an instance of SQLAlchemy DeclarativeBase."""
            assert isinstance(Base, DeclarativeBase)
        ```

2.  **Test: Can Define a Model Inheriting from `Base`**
    *   **Description:** Ensure that a simple model can be defined by inheriting from `Base` and that basic SQLAlchemy model attributes are correctly set.
    *   **Test Code Snippet:**
        ```python
        from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
        from app.db.base import Base

        def test_model_inheritance_from_base() -> None:
            """Test defining a model by inheriting from Base."""
            class TestModel(Base):
                __tablename__ = "test_model"
                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
                name = Column(String)

            assert hasattr(TestModel, '__tablename__')
            assert TestModel.__tablename__ == "test_model"
            assert hasattr(TestModel, 'metadata')
            assert TestModel.metadata == Base.metadata
        ```

**Step 5: Implement `app/db/base.py`**

```python
"""
SQLAlchemy base class for declarative models.
"""
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# Create a base class for declarative models
Base = declarative_base()
```

**Step 6: Run Tests for `app/db/base.py`**

Run pytest specifically for `tests/db/test_base.py`:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/db/test_base.py
```

Debug and adjust `app/db/base.py` and tests until all tests pass.

**Step 7: Review and Refine**

*   **Code Review:** Review `app/db/session.py` and `app/db/base.py` for clarity, correctness, and adherence to best practices.
*   **Configuration Review:** Double-check how database URLs are constructed and used from `app.core.config.py`. Ensure separation of concerns for configuration.
*   **Error Handling:** Consider potential database connection errors and how they are handled (although FastAPI's dependency injection will handle exceptions raised in `get_db`).
*   **Production Readiness:** Ensure the chosen settings (`pool_pre_ping`, `expire_on_commit`, `autoflush`) are suitable for a production environment.

**Step 8: Commit Changes**

Commit the implemented code and tests with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add app/db/session.py app/db/base.py tests/db/test_session.py tests/db/test_base.py
git commit -m "Implement and test database setup (SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL)"
```

**Potential Challenges and Mitigation:**

*   **Database Connection Issues:** Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible. Verify database credentials in `.env` are correct. Test connection strings thoroughly.
*   **Asynchronous SQLAlchemy Configuration:** Double-check SQLAlchemy documentation for asynchronous setup with `asyncpg`. Ensure all operations are `async` and `await`.
*   **Testing Database Setup:**  Initially, tests might be run against the development database. For more isolated and reliable testing, consider setting up a separate test database (as outlined in `README.md` roadmap point 3 and future enhancements).  For now, ensure test settings in `conftest.py` are used.
*   **Dependency Injection and Testing:**  Testing dependency injection can sometimes be tricky. The tests here focus on unit testing the functions themselves. Integration tests will further validate the dependency injection in API endpoints in later roadmap steps.

By following this detailed plan, you will have a solid foundation for database interaction in your FastAPI application, adhering to production-first principles and test-driven development. This setup will be crucial for implementing the subsequent roadmap items like User Model and API endpoints.
