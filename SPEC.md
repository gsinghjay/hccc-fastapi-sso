# Technical Specification

## System Overview
The system is a FastAPI-based Single Sign-On (SSO) application designed to handle user authentication, authorization, and management. The primary components include the FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, Docker for containerization, and Traefik for reverse proxy and SSL termination. The system is structured to adhere to best practices in software development, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), code quality tools (ruff, mypy, black), and SOLID principles.

### Main Components
- **Frontend Components**: Not explicitly detailed in the provided specification, but typically would include web interfaces or client applications interacting with the API.
- **Backend Services**: FastAPI application handling API requests, user authentication, and business logic.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for storing user data and application state.
- **External APIs**: Potential integration with external services for enhanced functionality (e.g., OAuth providers).

## Core Functionality
### Primary Features
1. **User Authentication and Management**
   - **Functions**: `authenticate_user`, `create_user`, `get_user`, `update_user`
   - **Files**: `app/services/auth.py`, `app/services/user.py`
   - **Description**: 
     - `authenticate_user`: Handles user login, verifies credentials, and generates JWT tokens.
     - `create_user`: Registers a new user in the system.
     - `get_user`: Retrieves user information by ID.
     - `update_user`: Updates user information.

2. **Health Checks and System Metrics**
   - **Functions**: `get_health_status`, `get_system_metrics`
   - **Files**: `app/services/health.py`
   - **Description**: 
     - `get_health_status`: Verifies the health of the system, including database connectivity.
     - `get_system_metrics`: Retrieves current system resource usage metrics.

3. **API Endpoints**
   - **Health Check (`/health`)**: Verifies API service status.
   - **Authentication (`/auth`)**: Handles user authentication and token verification.
   - **User Management (`/users`)**: Manages user registration, profile retrieval, and updates.

### Complex Algorithms and Business Logic
- **JWT Token Generation and Validation**: Implemented in `app/services/auth.py` using Pydantic models for secure and validated token management.
- **Database Operations**: Asynchronous database interactions using SQLAlchemy 2.0, ensuring efficient and non-blocking operations.
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure and validated environment variable management using Pydantic Settings, detailed in `.cursor/rules/environment-variables.mdc`.

## Architecture
### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Incoming Requests**:
   - Clients send HTTP requests to the FastAPI application via defined API endpoints.
2. **Request Processing**:
   - Requests are routed to appropriate handlers (`app/services/*`).
   - Middleware processes requests for security, logging, and rate limiting.
3. **Database Interaction**:
   - Asynchronous database operations are performed using SQLAlchemy 2.0.
   - Data validation is handled by Pydantic models before and after database operations.
4. **Response Generation**:
   - Responses are formatted according to OpenAPI specifications and sent back to the client.
5. **Health and Metrics**:
   - Health checks and system metrics are periodically collected and can be accessed via dedicated endpoints.

### Component Interaction
- **FastAPI Application**: Central component handling all API requests and business logic.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores all persistent data, interacted with via SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy managing SSL termination, routing, and security headers.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.
